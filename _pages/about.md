About me
======
I am a graduate student with interests lying in medical image analysis, reinforcement learning, self-supervised learning, and medical image reconstruction. I got my bachelar degree from Zhejiang University in 2019. After that, I joined the [Computational Imaging Lab](https://www.ji.sjtu.edu.cn/research/laboratories/laboratory-detail/523/) at Shanghai Jiao Tong University and received my Master degree in 2022. I will continue my interdisciplinary research between medical image analysis and deep reinforcement learning under the supervision of [Prof. Pheng Ann Heng](http://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/~pheng/)  and pursue my Ph.D degree with the Department of Computer Science at Chinese University of Hong Kong.
