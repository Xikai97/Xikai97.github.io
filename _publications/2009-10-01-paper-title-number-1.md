In this work, we develop a new image reconstruction approach based on a novel multilayer model learned in an unsupervised manner by combining both sparse representations and deep models. The proposed framework extends the classical sparsifying transform model for images to a Multilayer residual sparsifying transform (MARS) model, wherein the transform domain data are jointly sparsified over layers. We investigate the application of MARS models learned from limited regular-dose images for low-dose CT reconstruction using penalized weighted least squares (PWLS) optimization.
